### Hi there!

I'm working on **goutube** and **ring** (go utility to build peer-to-peer architecture easily) to optimize the multi-stream protocol. I earlier developed these utilities to help developers build largely-scalable, highly available, fast, secure ***distributed*** streaming APIs!

### Useful books
[Foundations of Scalable Systems By Ian Gorton](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/) and [Distributed Services with Go By Travis Jeffery](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-services-with/9781680508376/) - allowed me to have strong understanding and expertise in building the scalable distributed systems!

[Hands-On Microservices with Kubernetes By Gigi Sayfan](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-microservices-with/9781789805468/) was worth the time (is a weighty tome) for automating the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing a container-centric infrastructure!
