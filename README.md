### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on distributed logging project, a largely-scalable, highly available, secure, and millisecond latency system to stream logging data.
- Iâ€™m currently learning [Foundations of Scalable Systems By Ian Gorton](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/) to have strong understanding and expertise on scalibility of the distributed systems (my favorite topic).
