### Hi there 👋

I'm working on [goutube](https://github.com/Brijeshlakkad/goutube) and [ring](https://github.com/Brijeshlakkad/ring) to help developers build largely-scalable, highly available, fast, secure ***distributed*** streaming APIs!

I’m learning [Foundations of Scalable Systems By Ian Gorton](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/) to have a strong understanding and expertise in building the scalable distributed systems 🔥.
