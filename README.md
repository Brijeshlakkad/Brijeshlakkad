### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on goutube and ring (go utility to build peer-to-peer architecture easily) to help developers build largely-scalable, highly available, fast, secure ***distributed*** streaming APIs!

Iâ€™m learning [Foundations of Scalable Systems By Ian Gorton](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/) to have a strong understanding and expertise in building the scalable distributed systems ðŸ”¥.
